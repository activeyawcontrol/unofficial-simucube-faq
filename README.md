# unofficial-simucube-faq

Facebook is bad at structuring information. The idea here is to make it easier to find answers to commonly asked questions.

# What else shouuld I read besides the Simucube owners group?

The Granite forums are also really helpful. A number of Granite employees hang out there and help people.

## Should I buy the Pro or the Ultimate?

...

# Setup/Installation

## How do I mount the standard, plastic, not-fancy emergency stop button?

Remove the 4 screws. There are two mounting holes which at least  for me lined up perfectly with the slots on  my 80/20 rig.

# Steering wheels / wheel rims

## How do I get a regular steering wheel (without a button box) on my Simucube?

## What wheels are available?

Superthread on the granite forums:
* https://community.granitedevices.com/t/steering-wheels-of-the-sc2-community/3155/41

## Does wired have any advantages over wireless?

The wireless is apparently limited to 28 inputs, which means that the wireless wheels are much less likely to have funky switches due to the number of required inputs.

## What are my wheel options, from cheapest to least cheap?

### Cheapest: replica race wheel, no button box

Replica Momo/OMP style wheels are super cheap.

Motamec wheels:
* https://www.motamec.com/motorsport-parts/motamec-interior/steering-wheels.html

Author's opinion: I have a Motamec D-shaped wheel on my NSH button box and it feels great. I also have a Sparco R383 for rally and I'm now questioning whether I should just use the Motamec for everything.

### Cheap: modify a wheel from a different ecosystem to work on the SC2

You may already have a wheel from a previous wheelbase that you can convert relatively inexpensively.

Thrustmaster conversion:

Fanatec conversion:

### Less cheap: replica race wheel, cheap wired button box

Cheap wired button boxes:

Penguin 
* http://www.penguinrc.com/penguinrc_simulation/made_for_SimuCUBE.html
* Needs an SC2 USB adapter

### Middle: race wheel + wired button box

For instance: Cube Controls wired wheels

### More: race wheel + wireless button box

For instance: Cube Controls wireless wheels

# Games, I mean Sims

## Can I use configurations from the Pro on the Sport?

Yes

... the available settings and their function is largely the same, so the same profile settings can be generally used for all Simucube 2 models."

# Troubleshooting

## My wheel shuts off randomly

* https://www.facebook.com/groups/361969411348399/permalink/562655917946413/
"Yes, check the PSU cable. However, please only adjust the cabling after unplugging the PSU from mains AC power to avoid arcing issues. We haven't seen any issues with Sport model that do this, so it is new to us."
